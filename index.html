                                <h5>Long live the Nations that Unite</h5>
                                <p align="justify">Since its founding in 1945, the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a> has been committed to finding peaceful solutions to international conflicts and political rivalries, always seeking to inhibit wars and massacres. But unfortunately, it still faces an enormous difficulty in promoting world peace and the reasons are diverse, among them the persistent tribalist and conservative nationalism still maintained by the nations. Perhaps you have read or heard some of the following historical statements:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"France has no friends, only interests."</li>
                                    <li>"England has no eternal friends, England has no perpetual enemies, England has only eternal and perpetual interests."</li>
                                    <li>"America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests."</li>
                                    <li>"Nations have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies, only permanent interests."</li>
                                    <li>"Countries never become friends, it is their interest for what they pretend to be friend."</li>
                                    <li>"Men can have friends, statesmen cannot."</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p align="justify">The greatest threat to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> is the risk of being discredited, of becoming a front political organization and having the same fate as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations">League of Nations</a>, which was created in 1919 but closed after three decades for not having fulfilled its main objective of prevent wars. It must be admitted, however, that several conflicts have occurred since the founding of the United Nations as a result of the failure of the respective negotiations. Even more worrying is the fact that many of these conflicts were caused by one or another founding country of the United Nations (China, United States, France, United Kingdom, Russia). The same countries that insist on maintaining absolute veto power, above all other United Nations members, in the United Nations Security Council.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Considering that the United Nations today has almost 200 members, it is unacceptable that a small group of only 5 countries reserves the right to decide on intervention in conflicts to save human lives. These founding countries present themselves as leaders of peace and freedom, but their actions denounce just the opposite, some cannot even be considered democracies. There were not few cases in which a founding country used its veto to prevent interventions, sometimes due to the fact that it had arms trade agreements with one of the countries involved, indirectly participating in conflicts as a supplier of arms and ammunition. Such attitudes set a bad example on the part of the founding countries, inevitably contributing to a loss of confidence in the peaceful intentions of the United Nations.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Despite all this, I still have hope that we can achieve a state of world peace, without armed conflicts or political rivalries. However, I am fully aware that we are still a long way from this ideal. After millennia of civilization we still have wars, massacres, genocides, heinous crimes, human rights violations, etc. In my opinion, we have forgotten the most important thing throughout history: we are all human, a single people of a single species. We are Sapiens, the last surviving species of the Homo lineage. We have a huge responsibility to keep evolution going to ensure the emergence and survival of the next species. We have a duty to leave a better world for our descendants; we need to protect our planet and its fauna at all costs.</p>
                                <p align="justify">In this sense, the first and most important attitude towards a better society would be to evolve our way of thinking and acting, abandoning the intolerance and territorialism that has accompanied us since the beginning. Establish as a basic premise in all cultures on the planet that we are all equal, without divisions of caste, gender, race, religion, fortune, ideology, etc. And this also includes restriction to any other type of prejudice or any other form of discrimination. But only a democratic society truly concerned with its citizens would be able to promote this type of behavior. There is no equality or respect for basic human rights in autocracies, which makes any progress towards peace impossible.</p>
                                <br />

                                <h5>New Wave of the Far Right</h5>
                                <p align="justify">In 2021, Brazil reached its lowest mark in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index">Democracy Index</a> of the British magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist">The Economist</a>, now classified as an "imperfect democracy" due to the president's continuous attacks on democratic institutions. We are not the only ones experiencing this type of democratic turmoil, other countries are also experiencing a similar crisis. However, the presence of extreme right-wing cells in all these countries is striking, threatening consolidated democracies through the same populism and nationalism practiced before the second world war. What is new here is the use of the internet, especially social networks, to spread hate speech against conveniently declared enemies. They have an expressive crowd of followers, among evangelical alienated, politically illiterate, fascist military, misogynist-racist playboys, greedy businessmen and ambitious religious leaders.</p>
                                <p align="justify">This recent rise of right-wing extremism in some nations poses a major risk to established democracies. Countries that surrender to dictatorial or fascist regimes are the ones that most disrespect the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. Not coincidentally, they also damage international relations and end up causing conflicts. Citizens of these nations need to be aware of the risk to which they are subject; must mobilize to inhibit dictatorial regimes and not allow the rise of military or extremist radicals. But they are often deceived by populist leaders and liars, naively becoming complicit in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Democracies_Die">death of democracy</a> in their country.</p>
                                <p align="justify">The Democracy Index indicates that the status of a democratic nation is transitory in some countries, constantly rising or falling in the rankings each year. This proves how fragile democracies end up becoming, bowing to any political, social or economic instability. Nordic countries in Europe are typically ranked at the top of the rankings. This could change in the coming years due to a recent wave of protests against the Islamic population, opportunely taken advantage of by right-wing conservative parties that have accumulated unprecedented victories.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Knowledge of the <a href="https://github.com/existo-me">political spectrum</a> is important to identify the real intent of certain autocratic leaders. They generally tend to act in a similar way - they are populist and nationalist at first, but end up resorting to authoritarianism after coming to power to stay there. These autocrats exploit the loopholes in the law in more tolerant societies and proceed towards power with false speeches of freedom of expression, always attacking the current government to discredit it and eventually replace it. To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana">George Santayana</a> in this context: "Those nations that cannot remember the past mistakes of other nations are doomed to repeat them."</p>
                                <br />

                                <h5>The Paradox of Tolerance</h5>
                                <p align="justify">Freedom and tolerance are part of the pillars of any truly democratic society. In a cunning way, tyrants take advantage of tolerance of new ideas and freedom of expression to attack their opponents with lies and demagogueries. As soon as they manage to come to power, they immediately assume an intolerant stance and eliminate any freedom of citizens so as not to be victims of the same tactic. Faced with this dilemma, the Austrian philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper">Karl Popper</a> questioned to what extent a society should be tolerant of the intolerant. In 1945, he released the book "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies">The Open Society and Its Enemies</a>", where he pointed out the existence of three paradoxes in the social environment:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Tolerance Paradox</b>: Unlimited tolerance leads to the disappearance of tolerance.</li>
                                    <li><b>Freedom Paradox</b>: Total freedom leads to the suppression of the weak by the strong.</li>
                                    <li><b>Democracy Paradox</b>: Democracy can turn into tyranny if the majority decides to be ruled by a tyrant.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p align="justify">The constitutions and penal codes of countries usually differ greatly regarding the rights of citizens to express opinions and ideas. In several European countries, denying the existence of crimes against humanity such as the Holocaust can lead to imprisonment. In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution allows Americans to create or participate in neo-Nazi organizations, while in Brazil, apology for Nazism has been a crime provided for by law since 1989. But Brazil is still tolerant of totalitarian ideologies such as dictatorship and fascism. President Bolsonaro himself denies that Brazil suffered a military coup in 1964 and became a dictatorship, openly defends the practice of torture, has already paid tribute to torturers of the military regime, suggested the closing of Congress, offended Supreme Court ministers numerous times and makes a point of telling his supporters "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minha-Especialidade-Matar-Bolsonarismo-Portuguese-ebook/dp/B089SBHXXZ/ref=sr_1_1">My specialty is killing</a>".</p>
                                <p align="justify">It is admirable that, nearly 80 years ago, Karl Popper was able to summarize in three simple ideas the biggest dilemmas facing democracies today. Even more fascinating is seeing the criticisms made by the Greek philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a> of democracy more than 2400 years ago become more pertinent today than ever before. Socrates believed that voting was a skill, not a random intuition, and therefore needed to be systematically taught to the people. Letting citizens vote without proper education would jeopardize democracy itself, as people's desire for easy answers could be exploited by demagogic and malicious politicians, who would eventually lead the country to disaster.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Popper's paradoxes and Socrates' pessimism bring to light the enormous complexity faced by government management. It is still not possible to indicate a country that has reached a condition of full, protected and incorruptible democracy. But each country has managed to deal with one or another aspect in this regard, and with relative success has learned important lessons. These lessons learned, from countries that have already experienced crises but managed to overcome and overcome specific threats, form a valuable and incomparable body of knowledge. All this know-how could be shared through an international initiative to support countries still at risk to democracy.</p>
                                <br />

                                <h5>The "United Sapiens" Initiative</h5>
                                <p align="justify">"United Sapiens" would be an interesting name for an initiative of this nature. Since greater unity between nations is not possible, as they are more focused on interests than friendship, then promoting greater unity between individuals would be a more feasible alternative. As more countries become members, this initiative could evolve into an intergovernmental organization, aiming to promote cooperation and exchange of experiences between countries with truly democratic policies. Countries that have a legally established commitment to democracy and that intend to remain free from authoritarianism or any other "ism" that threatens their democracy. "United Sapiens", as a worldwide organization, would have the potential to perform even more relevant goals:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Definition of legal compliance rules to maintain democracy;</li>
                                    <li>Sharing lessons learned in political and social aspects;</li>
                                    <li>Assistance in election observation missions for compliance audits;</li>
                                    <li>Collaboration in the areas of scientific research and technological development;</li>
                                    <li>Exchanges at universities for students, researchers and professors;</li>
                                    <li>And, who knows, much more...</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p align="justify">A country like Brazil, which has recently had its democratic institutions paired up in favor of the extreme right, would greatly benefit from any initiative to safeguard its democracy. We have received support from various international entities in this regard, not only from other government leaders, but also from press NGOs and world organizations such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_American_States">OAS</a>. But if Brazil follows the path of authoritarianism, there is not much these entities could do except turn up their noses and wish them good luck.</p>
                                <p align="justify">Unfortunately, I cannot see the United Nations at the forefront of such an important initiative, when the worst human rights violators in the world are part of its Human Rights Council. And for my part, I don't have the conditions to create a "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446850/">megastructure</a>" of this size, it goes far beyond a single individual all the effort and resources needed. But if at least two State leaders were interested in the idea and made themselves available to discuss a likely venture, surely something could already be started.</p>
                                <br />

                                <h5>The "We The Sapiens" Mantra</h5>
                                <p align="justify">There is not much I can do in terms of international politics, my professional experience has always been in the area of Information Technology. But currently there is a new form of relationship between countries, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jouximzU1k">Digital Diplomacy</a>. Basically it's the use of social media and other digital platforms - by government leaders, ministers of affairs and other foreign policy actors - to help achieve diplomatic goals. It is something quite recent, but it has generated a considerable impact on the relations between the countries that are present in this virtual universe. As an example, the rapprochement between United States and Cuba, during the Barack Obama Administration, was facilitated through contacts initiated in social networks.</p>
                                <p align="justify">With this in mind, I created the mantra "We, The Sapiens", a short text in the form of a poem, in hopes of reaching both citizens and foreign policy actors around the world. Inspire them to consider new directions for their nations, "planting the idea" that a better world is possible. There is a wave of tribalism advancing on societies, generating intolerance and violence. These people need to be aware that it all started with a single tribe, to which our Homo sapiens ancestors belonged. What happened from there is our story, but we need to write a new story if we want a better future for our descendants.</p>
