The slides I have already added were made using online translation tools, which is not 100% correct. I wish I could add slides for every country in the world, but I don't have the knowledge of the languages. I have received some suggestions on the web, due to some posts I made on Imgur and Reddit, and I have corrected the translations made so far. That's why I would like the help from people in each country to translate the **We The Sapiens** mantra and the **Overview** of the United Sapiens' organization into each language. if you are interested you can also contribute...   :thumbsup:


## Why jQuery?

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have been using the Angular framework in the last 5 years. This year I started studying the React framework, which is very requested in job offers. These frameworks are very good, but they don't compare to jQuery in terms of market share: 77.4% of all websites on the Internet use jQuery (October, 2022). My decision for using jQuery was based on the large number of developers who are not yet familiar with these new frameworks.

## How To Include New Slide

To create a new slide with the mantra translated into your country's official language, create a new file **xx-xx.htm** in the *slides* directory, using UTF-8 encoding. There is a script to automatically include slides in the carousel for each file found in the *slides* directory.

The name and contents of the file must follow the same conventions adopted in existing files. Preferably, use the [**ISO 639-1 Language Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of your language (2 letters in lowercase) and the [**ISO 3166-1 Country Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp) of your country (2 letters in lowercase).

You can also include the flag of your country, using the convention for name **xx.jpg**, where 'xx' is the [**ISO 3166-1 Country Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp) of your country (2 letters in lowercase). Preferably, use the **JPG** format. For best viewing, the flag image must be at least 1000 pixels in width and/or height. You can probably find the flag of your country on Wikipedia.


## How To Include New Translation

To create a new version of the "Organization Overview" content, translated into your country's official language, create a new file **README_xx.md** in the *.github/profile* repository, using UTF-8 encoding. The contents of the file must follow the same conventions adopted in existing files. Preferably, use the [**ISO 639-1 Language Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of your language (2 letters in lowercase).
