The slides I have already added were made using online translation tools, which is not 100% correct. I wish I could add slides for every country in the world, but I don't have the knowledge of the languages. I have received some suggestions on the web, due to some posts I made on Imgur and Reddit, and I have corrected the translations made so far. That's why I would like the help from people in each country to translate the **United Sapiens' Clamor** and the **"About This"** text into each language. if you are interested you can also contribute...   :thumbsup:

## How To Include New Slide

To create a new slide with the clamor translated into your country's official language, create a new file **xx-xx.htm** in the *slides* directory, using UTF-8 encoding. There is a script to automatically include slides in the carousel for each file found in the *slides* directory.

The name and contents of the file must follow the same conventions adopted in existing files. Preferably, use the [**ISO 639-1 Language Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of your language (2 letters in lowercase) and the [**ISO 3166-1 Country Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp) of your country (2 letters in lowercase).

You can also include the flag of your country, using the convention for name **xx.jpg**, where 'xx' is the [**ISO 3166-1 Country Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp) of your country (2 letters in lowercase). Preferably, use the **JPG** format. For best viewing, the flag image must be at least 1000 pixels in width and/or height. You can probably find the flag of your country on Wikipedia.


## How To Include New Translation

To create a new version of the "About This" content, translated into your country's official language, create a new file **xx-xx.htm** in the *translations* directory, using UTF-8 encoding. There is a script to automatically include translations in the homepage for each file found in the *translations* directory.

The name and contents of the file must follow the same conventions adopted in existing files. Preferably, use the [**ISO 639-1 Language Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of your language (2 letters in lowercase) and the [**ISO 3166-1 Country Code**](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp) of your country (2 letters in lowercase).
